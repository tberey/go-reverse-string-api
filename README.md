# String Reverse, REST API - GET Request to a local server.



### A RESTful API, made in Go, that performs a simple GET request to a local http server, against the query string passed. The API url query takes any string as a value with it's paired key "text", in such a way that your url looks like this: 'http://localhost:8080/?text=<yourString>'. This string is then simply reversed, and returned in the response body.
